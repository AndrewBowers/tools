*trace

Usage
=====
Run *trace.prc (choose which dump you need) and do action you want to trace. On next 
run *trace should be unregistered and you can get dump on SD/MMC card located in /GPIO.txt.

For gpiotrace you can use gpiotrace2html (by Alex) with simple usage:

gpiotrace2html GPIO.txt already_known.gpios > result.html

already_known.gpios has syntax
GPIO_number<tab>GPIO_name

You can also try slow, but configurable shell parser gpiotrace.sh.

gpiotrace.sh [GPLR|GPDR|GAFR_L|GAFR_U] GPIO.txt


If you want to add other registers for dump - check include/regs.h for inspiration.

History
=======

Marex took WhineHack (by Alex) and changed it into dumping GPIO related registers. Sleep_Walker
add other dumping to already done code. End of story.
