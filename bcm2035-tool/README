BCM2035-tool
************

	This package contains a small utility to initialize and to update
the firmware of the bcm2035 bluetooth chip on the Motorola EZX Platform and
Palm devices with this chip.

	This chip has some custom HCI commands, to change the BDADDR and to
patch the original firmware. This tool can make use of both.

Instructions:
-------------


    You can use the motorola firmware by #defining PATCH_FIRMWARE, and the
Broadcom original firmware by leaving it commented. The chip works fine with
both firmwares, and i havent found yet what difference the motorola version 
does.
	Turn on the chip by sending "AT+EBTP=1\r" to BP, and run the tool.


Regards,

Daniel Ribeiro
